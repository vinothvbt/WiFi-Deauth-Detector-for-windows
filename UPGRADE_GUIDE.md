## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **v1.0 Architecture**
```
[WiFi Adapter] → [Monitor Mode] → [Scapy] → [Packet Analysis] → [Attack Detection]
```

### **v2.0 Architecture**  
```
[Windows WLAN API] → [Connection Events] → [Pattern Analysis] → [Threat Detection]
```

### **Detection Logic Changes**

**v1.0 Detection:**
- Monitors deauth/disassoc packets
- Identifies source and target MAC
- Real-time packet inspection

**v2.0 Detection:**
- Monitors connection state changes
- Analyzes disconnect patterns
- Detects suspicious timing

### **Pattern Detection Examples**

```python
# v2.0 Suspicious Patterns
patterns = {
    "frequent_disconnects": "3+ disconnects in 5 minutes",
    "rapid_cycles": "Connect/disconnect cycles < 30 seconds", 
    "unexpected_drops": "Signal strength vs disconnect correlation",
    "timing_analysis": "Regular interval disconnects"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### **Demo Mode**
v2.0 includes a safe testing mode:

```python
# Enable in Settings → Demo Mode
# Generates simulated events for testing:
# - Webhook notifications
# - Auto-switching behavior  
# - Logging functionality
# - UI responsiveness
```

### **Real-World Testing**
```bash
# Connect to primary WiFi
# Configure backup network
# Enable monitoring
# Test actual disconnection scenarios
```

### **Validation Checklist**
- [ ] Application starts without special permissions
- [ ] Monitoring activates successfully
- [ ] Network list populates correctly
- [ ] Discord webhooks function properly
- [ ] Auto-switching works as expected
- [ ] Logs capture events accurately

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Migration Issues**

**Issue: "No networks detected"**
```bash
Solution: 
1. Ensure WiFi is enabled
2. Click "Refresh Networks" in Settings
3. Check Windows network profiles with: netsh wlan show profiles
```

**Issue: "Monitoring not starting"**
```bash
Solution:
1. No administrator rights needed in v2.0
2. Check demo mode is disabled for real monitoring
3. Verify WiFi adapter is functional
```

**Issue: "No events detected"**
```bash
Solution:
1. v2.0 focuses on YOUR connection only
2. Enable demo mode to test functionality
3. Check connection stability of current network
```

**Issue: "Auto-switching not working"**
```bash
Solution:
1. Ensure backup network is saved in Windows
2. Test manual connection: netsh wlan connect name="BackupNetwork"
3. Check backup network is in range
```
